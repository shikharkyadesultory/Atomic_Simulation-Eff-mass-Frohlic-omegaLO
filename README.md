1. The Neuromorphic computing file develops a cif for a mermistor which is under construction :- involves the configuration of Ag/PMMA/HP/PEDOT:PSS/ITO
2. The High Throughput computing file contains the script for automating the formation process of possibilities which under Spin Orbit Coupled optimization reveals Rasbha Splitting
3. Note :- If unknown what is being done while executing the hihg throughput computing script prefer going on with only a single configuration
